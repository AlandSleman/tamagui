description: Get Tamagui set up, step by step
---

We recommend using the cli to bootstrap an example app, even if only as a reference for you as your set an existing app up:

```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```

## Install

You can use the 0-dependency core, or move on level higher to using `tamagui` itself which has many components and is a superset of core.

For the lighter core style library:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/core
```

If you are going to use the Tamagui components, you can avoid core and just:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

Tamagui doesn't require any special bundler or configuration, but it does let you set up a design system if you'd like. Beyond adding the core `TamaguiProvider`, you are ready to start styling your app.

## Quick configuration

For an in-depth setup, check out [the full configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration). We also provide a nice set of defaults, the same setup the Tamagui site itself uses:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/config
```

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file at the root of your project:

```tsx
// the v2 config imports the css driver on web and react-native on native
// for reanimated: @tamagui/config/v2-reanimated
// for react-native only: @tamagui/config/v2-native
import { config } from '@tamagui/config/v2'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const tamaguiConfig = createTamagui(config)

// this makes typescript properly type everything based on the config
type Conf = typeof tamaguiConfig
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default tamaguiConfig

// depending on if you chose tamagui, @tamagui/core, or @tamagui/web
// be sure the import and declare module lines both use that same name
```

Add TamaguiProvider to your root:

```tsx line=8-14
// this provides some helpful reset styles to ensure a more consistent look
// only import this from your web app, not native
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'

import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

You're all set!

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Hello world</Button>
}
```

From here, [spend some time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration). You can set up the Compiler, but we'd recommend waiting and doing that once you're ready to deploy.

#### Web-only

If you are only targeting web, want to save some bundle size, and are ok going without the React Native specific props like gesture handlers and onLayout, you can just use `web`:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/web
```

Note that `@tamagui/web` is the same library as `@tamagui/core`, just dropping support for a few React Native specific things, mostly props: the `GestureResponderHandlers` and `onLayout` props are absent, and the platform methods on refs like `measureInWindow` are as well.
