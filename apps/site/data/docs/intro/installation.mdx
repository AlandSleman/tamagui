description: How to get Tamagui set up.
---

We recommend using the cli to bootstrap one of the example apps, whether you use it directly or just as reference when implementing in your stack.

```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```

## Install

If you want tamagui with all the components:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

If you just want `core` which includes the styling primitives as well as the base `Stack` and `Text` components:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/core
```

And you can now import and start using Tamagui. We do recommend [walking through configuration](#quick-configuration) for a basic design system, media queries, themes and more.

Once you start using libraries from the React Native ecosystem, you likely need some extra setup. For example, React Native supports "platform specific" file extensions (ie, bundlers should import `index.web.js` when targeting web and importing `./index.js`). Many packages also import `react-native` directly and so on the web you'll need to alias `react` to `react-native-web`.

Tamagui does not require this to work out of the box, but eventually you'll probably want compatibility with the rest of the React Native ecosystem, so we have plugins which automate it, alongside allowing you to opt-in to the optimizing compiler.

If you just want to get going, don't worry about it for now and continue to [quick configuration](#quick-configuration) or [the full configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration).

### Bundler plugins

The bundler plugins generally set up platform specific extension support, alias react-native to react-native-web, and can enable the optimizing compiler.

#### Webpack

You can just use the TamaguiPlugin:

```tsx
const { TamaguiPlugin } = require('tamagui-loader')

config.plugins.push(
  new TamaguiPlugin({
    config: './src/tamagui.config.ts',
    components: ['tamagui'], // matching the yarn add you chose above
  }),
)
```

Or manually set it up:

```tsx
// some stuff for react-native
config.plugins.push(
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    process: {
      env: {
        __DEV__: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'true' : 'false',
        NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
      },
    },
  })
)

config.resolve.alias['react-native$'] = 'react-native-web'

// set up web extensions
compiler.options.resolve.extensions = [
  '.web.tsx',
  '.web.ts',
  '.web.js',
  '.ts',
  '.tsx',
  '.js',
]
```

#### Vite

```tsx
import { tamaguiExtractPlugin, tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

export default {
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tamaguiPlugin(tamaguiConfig),
    // optional:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? tamaguiExtractPlugin(tamaguiConfig) : null,
  ].filter(Boolean),
}
```

Or manually set it up:

```tsx
// for react-native
config.define = {
  __DEV__: `${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? true : false}`,
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
}

config.resolve.alias['react-native'] = 'react-native-web'

// set up web extensions
config.optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions = {
  ...config.optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions,
  resolveExtensions: [
    '.web.js',
    '.web.jsx',
    '.web.ts',
    '.web.tsx',
    '.mjs',
    '.js',
    '.mts',
    '.ts',
    '.jsx',
    '.tsx',
    '.json'
  ],
  loader: {
    '.js': 'jsx',
  },
}
```

### Native

For React Native or Expo you shouldn't need any plugins unless you're setting up the optimizing compiler which we highly recommend doing only once you're ready to ship your app to production. That install process is explained in the [Compiler installation docs](/docs/intro/compiler-install).

---

## Quick configuration

For an in-depth setup, check out [the full configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration). For a nice set of defaults:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/config
```

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file at the root of your project:

```tsx
// the v2 config imports the css driver on web and react-native on native
// for reanimated: @tamagui/config/v2-reanimated
// for react-native only: @tamagui/config/v2-native
import { config } from '@tamagui/config/v2'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const tamaguiConfig = createTamagui(config)

// this makes typescript properly type everything based on the config
type Conf = typeof tamaguiConfig
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default tamaguiConfig

// depending on if you chose tamagui, @tamagui/core, or @tamagui/web
// be sure the import and declare module lines both use that same name
```

And finally, you just need to add the TamaguiProvider to your root:

```tsx line=8-14
// this provides some helpful reset styles to ensure a more consistent look
// only import this from your web app, not native
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'

import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

TamaguiProvider has optional props, [see the docs for them here](/docs/core/configuration#using-tamagui-provider).

### Done!

You're ready to use Tamagui:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Hello world</Button>
}
```

We recommend [spending time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration) from here, skipping over the Compiler setup. The compiler is optional and should be saved for setting up after you've built something you'd like to test it with.

#### Saving bundle size for web-only use cases

If you are only targeting web, want to save some bundle size, and are ok going without the React Native specific props like gesture handlers and onLayout, you can just use `web`:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/web
```

If you are _only_ targeting the web: `@tamagui/web` is the same library as `@tamagui/core`, except that it drops support for a few React Native specific things, mostly props: namely the `GestureResponderHandlers` and `onLayout` props are absent, and the platform methods on refs like `measureInWindow` are absent. If you are only targeting web, you can swap every reference of `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` in this guide with `@tamagui/web`. Note that you can't use `@tamagui/web` with `tamagui` as the full `tamagui` package relies on many of these props.
