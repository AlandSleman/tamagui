<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is a modular style solution for React that brings powerful new style abilities
  to React Native, while aiming to be competetive with the best web-only style libraries.
</IntroParagraph>

<GetStarted />

You can pick and choose which parts of Tamagui you use:

- [`@tamagui/core`](/docs/core/configuration) is a typed style library with design system features, like [Stitches](https://stitches.dev).
- [`@tamagui/static`](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler) is a smart optimizing compiler that emits 0-runtime code, even when faced with logic-filled inline styles, like [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle).
- [`tamagui`](/docs/components/stacks) is a large suite of components and hooks that are made to work well on all platforms.

### `@tamagui/core`

After [configuring](/docs/core/configuration), use `@tamagui/core` inline:

```tsx
import { View, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const App = () => (
  <View backgroundColor="red" borderRadius={10}>
    <Text color="white">Hello</Text>
  </View>
)
```

or with the `styled` utility:

```tsx
import { View, Theme, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const AvatarCircle = styled(View, {
  // use direct values
  backgroundColor: '#000',

  // or use values typed in createTamagui() themes and tokens
  shadowColor: '$color2',

  pressStyle: {
    scale: 1.05,
  },

  variants: {
    pin: {
      floating: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: '$xs',
        left: '$xs',
      },
    },

    featured: {
      true: {
        scale: 1.1,
        borderRadius: 12,
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

export const App = () => (
  <Theme name="light">
    <AvatarCircle pin="floating" featured />
  </Theme>
)
```

Core also has a complete design system you can set up easily with `createTamagui`.

[Read more about Core](http://localhost:5005/docs/core/configuration)

#### Design System

Using [createTamagui](/docs/core/configuration) you can generate a fully-typed design system with colors, tokens, spacing, sizing, fonts, themes, shorthands, animations, and more, that work with well-optimized and easy to use hooks like [useMedia](/docs/core/use-media) and [useTheme](/docs/core/use-theme).

### `@tamagui/static`

The `@tamagui/static` package is an optimizing compiler for React that does much more than just extracting CSS styles. It significantly speeds up the runtime of apps by flattening your styled views as their call-sites, handling even tricky dynamic styles there, and outputting a `div` (on the web) or `View` (on native).

There's a lot to it, and good reasons it exists, but are [discussed more on the compiler introduction](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler).

### `tamagui`

Above that, [the Tamagui UI Kit](/docs/components/views) for building full-featured app interfaces right out of the box. Featuring powerful, themeable components that scale across every size in your design system. Enjoy Radix-like composable component APIs that always visually adapt properly to each platform.
